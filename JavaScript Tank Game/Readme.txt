This was a scholar project that made me familiar with JavaScript. 
The initial game engine was taken from https://github.com/r-wang/Javascript-tank-game


Changes made to the initial code:

- visual aspect completely changed through the use of different images;
- added a "blasting" sound for when a tank is firing;
- added more maps, designed to be increasingly more challenging;
- increasing number of enemy tanks each level, for higher difficulty;
- added a legend to explain the controls;
- added a counter for the remaining enemy tanks.

Although my contribution to the original code was not very substantial, this project made me understand the fundamentals of JavaScript. To note is that this project remains as "work in progress".
