This project was made in 2013 for the Web Design module during my undergraduate course. The project enhanced my designing skills in Photoshop, Illustrator, HTML, and CSS. In addition, a JavaScript slider has been used and some PHP for the contact form and basic calculations.
To note is that this webpage should be opened in Firefox through the index.php file as it has not been tested in all browsers.
