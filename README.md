This was a scholar project that made me familiar with JavaScript. 
The initial game engine was taken from https://github.com/r-wang/Javascript-tank-game


Changes made to the initial code:

- added more collision rules and removed a few bugs;
- visual aspect completely changed through the use of different images ;
- added a "blasting" sound for when a tank is firing;
- added more maps, designed to be increasingly more challenging;
- increasing number of enemy tanks each level, for higher difficulty;
- added a shield object that all tanks can collect, up to a maximum of 3;
- added visual appearance for all tanks having shields;
- added a legend to explain the controls;
- added a counter for the remaining enemy tanks and shields held by the user-controlled tank.
- added a mute button under the form of a slider to toggle mute on and off;
- different background for each level;
